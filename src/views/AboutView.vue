        <p class="italic font-medium mb-3">About this project and me</p>
        <p>(: I used this project as a playground to learn and practice some stuff about Vue 3 with router
            and TailwindCSS along with some JavaScript libraries for better experience.
            <br>
            This concept is nothing new, but with this project I connected my big hobby and profession.
            <br>
            I have been working as a software developer for around six years, mainly on backend side with PHP and Laravel
            but frontend side is also well known to me.
            <br>
            Learning new skills/technologies and applying them on a daily job is my favorite part of being developer.
            <br>
            In spare time I like to read comics, to play board games, to walk, to listen to music... :)
