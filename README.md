# About Board Game Collection project

Board Game Collection is a hobby project made with Vue3 JS and TailwindCSS and I used it like a playground to practice/learn some stuff about previosly mentioned frontend technologies. With this project I also connected my big board games hobby and practicing/learning frontend technologies.

With this project user can search for board games, add them to collection, log play for board games in collection, delete them from collection, see logged plays.
